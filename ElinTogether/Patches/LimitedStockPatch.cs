///     The item in the merchant's chest is the ledger: it carries how many each player bought already. When
///     some leave the chest for a player, the game that keeps the shop lays the whole stack in the chest again
///     and notes them for that player; nobody can buy more than the stack holds, in all. At each restock the game is let to make every limited item again (its
///     own memory of them, <c>player.noRestocks</c>, is set aside for the time of the restock), and what the chest
///     already holds is kept instead of the new one: a world played before this finds its limited items back at the
